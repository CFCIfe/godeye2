Does that make me a bit of a toxic male? At least I know my problems.\nMix that and what you get is sometimes, some of my concepts are initially based on myself, before I go on to project these on some other willing collaborator\n I shot this behind the scenes while on commission for @redd_moustache who is actually in this case.. the aforementioned collaborator.
